Project Improvement Plan: Making Things Easier for Users

Hi my name is sukhdeep Singh,
•	I've got a plan to make my project more user-friendly, and I'm excited to share the details. Let's keep it simple and effective.

Fixing What Needs Fixing

1. Making Login Better:
•	I'm going to spruce up the login page, so it's smoother for everyone. Also, I'll add a "Remember Me" option to make it more convenient.

2. Carousel Tweaks:
•	I'll adjust the carousel settings to avoid any hiccups when people sign up or log in. We want the process to be frustration-free.

3. Say Goodbye to Frustration:
•	I've noticed some users getting frustrated during sign-up, especially because of the carousel. I'm going to fix that to make things better for everyone.

What Comes First?

Here's the plan:

Better Login Comes First:
•	I'll upgrade the login process and add the "Remember Me" feature. Making things easier right from the start.

Carousel Fixes Next:
•	Tweaking the carousel settings is up next. Let's ensure it doesn't cause any headaches for our users.

How I'll Get It Done

For the technical stuff: -

1. Better Login:
•	I'll check out Lara Cast videos to learn some cool tricks.
•	Using what's in Chapters 11-13 of our course material to keep things secure.

2. Carousel Fixes:
•	I'll grab some tips from reliable online sources to get the carousel just right.

When I’ll get it done 
•	I will get everything done till next milestone (Milestone-4)
